Federated learning systems have multiple clients (otherwise there's not much to federate, is there?). Each client will be represented by its own instance of `FlwrClient`. If you have, for example, three clients in your workload, you'd have three instances of `FlwrClient`. Flower calls `FlwrClient.fit` on the respective instance when the server selects a particular client for training (and `FlwrClient.evaluate` for evaluation)."
